# Optimizing-Ride-Services-Through-Demand-Prediction

üìå Project Description:
This project focuses on enhancing the operational efficiency and customer satisfaction of a ride-hailing platform like Rapido by accurately predicting ride demand across different geographical locations and times of day.
By analyzing historical ride request data, temporal trends, and environmental factors (such as time of day, day of the week, holidays, and weather conditions), we aim to build a machine learning model that forecasts how many rides will be requested in specific areas at specific times.

Accurate demand prediction enables better driver allocation, dynamic pricing, and reduced rider wait time, ultimately leading to a more responsive and cost-effective ride service.

üéØ Objectives:
Predict the number of ride requests per zone in hourly time slots.

Identify high-demand hotspots during peak hours.

Enable proactive driver reallocation and surge pricing mechanisms.

Minimize idle time for drivers and waiting time for customers.

üìÇ Data Requirements:
Historical ride request logs (timestamp, location, ride status)

Time-based features (hour, day, weekend, holidays)

Optional: weather data, event calendars, traffic data

üîç Methodology:
Data Preprocessing

Cleaning missing values

Feature engineering (time slots, zones, lags)

Geospatial clustering (e.g., K-means or hexagonal bins)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Heatmaps of ride demand by location and time

Correlation analysis with external factors

Modeling

Baseline: Linear Regression, Random Forest

Advanced: LSTM (for time series), XGBoost

Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, MAPE

Deployment (optional)

Build an interactive dashboard (Tableau / Power BI / Streamlit)

Integrate with ride allocation system via an API (Flask/FastAPI)

üí° Expected Outcomes:
A predictive model capable of forecasting hourly ride demand with high accuracy.

Heatmaps and dashboards to visualize ride hotspots.

Actionable insights for driver distribution, marketing strategies, and surge pricing.
